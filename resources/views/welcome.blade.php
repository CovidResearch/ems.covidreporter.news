    <h1>The Coronavirus EMS Tracker</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to the Coronavirus EMS Tracker! Here we aim to log coronavirus-related EMS dispatches in America's hotspots.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal of this project is to independently log and record coronavirus-related EMS dispatches so that we can have
        a much better realistic grasp of just how widespread <strong>and *DEADLY*</strong> COVID-19 really is.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project was inspired by findings that Houston, Texas, has been dramatically undercounting the number of
        coronavirus deaths, by mislabeling them as deaths by pneumonia and the coverall "Cardiac Arrest".
